# ResNet-Inception-and-VGG-models
This project compares ResNet, Inception, and VGG models on an image classification task. It involves data preprocessing, model training with transfer learning, and performance evaluation. The analysis includes accuracy, loss curves, and insights into each architecture's strengths and weaknesses.
# Overview
## The comparison focuses on:

#### Training each model with data augmentation to improve generalization.
#### Monitoring the loss and accuracy curves throughout the training process for a better understanding of the learning behavior of each model.
#### Evaluating the models on a test set to measure their final performance in terms of accuracy and loss.
#### sing model checkpoints to load the best-performing weights for each architecture and compare them in a controlled evaluation.
# Key Features
## Implementation of three architectures:
#### VGG: A deep network with small, fixed-size convolutional filters, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.
#### ResNet: Incorporates residual connections to facilitate the training of very deep networks, helping to avoid the vanishing gradient problem.
#### Inception: Uses a multi-branch architecture to capture features at different scales, making it more computationally efficient while maintaining high accuracy.
## Visualization of Training and Validation Metrics:
#### Plots are generated for training and validation loss and accuracy over each epoch.
#### Helps in understanding the model's performance trends and potential overfitting.
## Test Set Evaluation:
#### Each model is evaluated on a test set, and metrics such as test loss and test accuracy are reported.
#### Comparative analysis of the results to highlight which model performs better under specific conditions.
# Requirements
## To run the project, the following dependencies are required:

#### Python 3.x
#### TensorFlow / Keras: For deep learning model implementation.
