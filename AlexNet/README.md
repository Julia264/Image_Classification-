# AlexNet for Image Classification

This directory contains the implementation of the AlexNet model for image classification using the same dataset shared across the other project in this repository (ResNet, Inception, and VGG).

## Overview
- **Model**: AlexNet
- **Dataset**: Same as used for ResNet, Inception, and VGG models
- **Task**: Image classification across multiple categories.

## How to Run
1. Ensure the dataset is available 
2. Open `alexnet-new.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
