## Project Overview

This project implements the AlexNet architecture for image classification using the Intel Image Classification dataset. Below are the details of each step involved in the project.

### Dataset Handling
The project uses the Intel Image Classification dataset, which consists of images divided into various categories, such as buildings, forests, mountains, etc. The dataset is loaded and prepared for training, validation, and testing.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques are applied to artificially expand the dataset and improve the model's generalization capabilities. Common techniques used include:
- Rotation
- Flipping
- Scaling
- Brightness adjustments

### Model Architecture - AlexNet
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network architecture implemented in this project using a deep learning library such as TensorFlow or Keras. The architecture consists of:
- Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max-pooling layers for downsampling
- Fully connected layers for classification
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization

### Training and Validation
The dataset is split into training and validation sets:
- The model is trained on the training set.
- Performance metrics (such as accuracy and loss) are monitored on the validation set to avoid overfitting.
- The optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD), loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy), and evaluation metrics (accuracy) are configured for training.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Various hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance, including:
- Learning rate
- Number of epochs
- Batch size

### Model Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test set by calculating accuracy and other relevant metrics. Additionally, a confusion matrix may be generated to analyze misclassifications.

### Prediction and Visualization
The trained model is used to predict labels for a set of test images. The predictions, along with the true labels, are visualized to provide a qualitative assessment of the model's performance.

### Hardware Acceleration
The notebook is configured to utilize GPU acceleration, allowing for faster training and evaluation.
